We now explore some examples of visualisations. Be aware there are so many possibilities out there for visualising your data. Think beyond the standard line or bar graphs!

### Visualise your thesis
[Visualise Your Thesis](https://library.unimelb.edu.au/research/visualise-your-thesis#resources) is an international competition run by the University of Melbourne that challenges Higher Degree by Research (HDR) students to summarise their research in an engaging, 60-second visual presentation using a supplied template, that encapsulates your research project. It gives you the opportunity to build essential digital communication skills so you can effectively communicate complex research to a general audience. Competition submissions are judged on their visual impact, and how well the content presents the research. The competition allows for multi-media, interactivity and interpretation and is suitable for all disciplines. The video here is from a 2019 winner, HDR student at UTS.

### Timelapse
- You can highlight that time lapses would work well for event set ups, constructing buildings, or use of infrastructure throughout a day. This Pea Shoot video is very peaceful and therapeutic.

- Google Earth Timelapse
[Google Earth Timelapse](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/) is a global, zoomable video that lets you see how the Earth has changed.

### Interactive graphs
- [New York Times' swing history graph](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/15/us/politics/swing-history.html) really impressess audience.

- [ABC 2020 US election story](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-02/us-election-trump-biden-states-polling/12822296) covers complex stories with data very clear way.

- This [word cloud](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/word-cloud.html) is developed with R Shiny.

- [Brisbane floods photo comparison](http://www.abc.net.au/news/specials/qld-floods/) presents how Brisbane was affected by 2011 floods by comparing photos. You can create this photo comparison by using a free tool introduced in HERE. 
  
### For R / Python users
If you are thinking of developing some visuals with R / Python, they will give you an idea together with coding :)

### Inspired by examples
[Data Viz Project](https://datavizproject.com/) gives you sooo many ideas about graph designs.

## Make sure your point can be seen
There are amazing and pretty looking visualisations, but, some visualisations may not be so clear that viewers can be confused and get lost.
So pictorials are amazing for relaying often complex and large amounts of information in easy to understand format. We can create some amazing, pretty and colourfully graphs, but if the user cannot clearly understand the point you are trying to relay, then the graph has failed. The next three graphs are examples of convoluted graphs. 

 {% include figure.html img="Unclear_example.png" alt="" width="50%" %}
The first graph shows how BI customers use their platforms. The y axis shows the breakdown of all the different platforms and how they are used, and the x axis shows cumulative percentages. For a start, cumulative percentage should be out of 100%, maybe it should be number of respondents? Beyond this though, its very difficult to compare different useages between platforms.
 
 {% include figure.html img="Unclear_example2.png" alt="" width="50%" %}
This graph would be better if it was the total users per platform.
This is a better way to present this graph as it breaks it down and present each use of platforms as its own graph. This allows for easy comparison between

## Simple techniques to make your point clear
There are a couple of simple techniques to make your point clearer. Here is a few:
- Headlines
- Callouts
- Highlight areas

What do they mean? Have a look at the video below!
